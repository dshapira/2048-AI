The audio is a simple Web Audio based oscillator bank and should work fine on most modern browsers.

### Suggested Improvements

1. Oscillator waveform selection

2. Tune the oscillator bank to a certain scale

3. Have the bank follow a midi file for frequency direction

4. Improve oscbank assignment efficiency.
